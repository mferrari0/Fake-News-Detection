# Fake-News-Detector

In this notebook I train 4 different NLP models for the detection of fake news from headlines:
- Bag of Words + Logistic Regression
- FastText Embeddings + CNN
- ALBERT (pre-trained model from the Tensorflow Hub)
- BERT (pre-trained model from Huggingface)



## The dataset
The dataset, containing news headlines, is collected from two news websites:

- TheOnion: sarcastic versions of current events.
- HuffPost: real (and non-sarcastic) news headlines.

Each record consists of three attributes: 
- is_sarcastic: 1 if the record is sarcastic (0 otherwise) 
- headline: the headline of the news article 
- article_link: link to the original news article. Useful in collecting supplementary data

## Approaches
At first I loaded and prepocessed the data. I also divided the data into train and test set. 

Then I tried 4 different models:

### Bag of Words + Logistic Regression 

Bag of Words (BOW) is an algorithm that transforms the text into fixed-length vectors. The algorithm counts the number of times the word is present in a document or, in this case, headline. The word occurrences allow to compare different headlines and evaluate their similarities. BOW represents the sentence as a bag of terms. It doesnâ€™t take into account the order and the structure of the words, but it only checks if the words appear in the document.

Once I have the BOW vector for each headline, I use **Logistic Regression** to train and test the model for detecting fake news headines. Accuracy is around **83%**, which is impressive already considering that BOW doesn't consider the order and structure of the words.

### FastText Embeddings + CNN

Fasttext embedding is a word to vector model: it represents each word as a vector. I used a pretrained model to generate, for each headline, a feature matrix, that is then used as input to a CNN model as shown in the picture. Accuracy is higher than with the previous model, but still not great.

### BERT pre-trained model from the Tensorflow Hub

BERT is a family of masked-language models published in 2018 by researchers at Google. It has become a ubiquitous baseline in NLP experiments counting over 150 research publications analyzing and improving the model. I downloaded the pre-trained model from the Tensorflow Hub and fine-tuned it with my dataset.
Accuracy increases to **89%**.

### BERT pre-trained model from Huggingface

I used the pre-trained model from the Huggingface repository. Accuracy increases to **92%**.

## SUMMARY

- Bag of Words + Logistic Regression show pretty good results for a quick deployment (83%)

- FastText Embeddings + CNN is also quick method and increases the accuracy to 

- Bert from HuggingFace has the best accuracy with 92% 


### Further steps: 
  - try other transformer-based models available from either the Tensorflow Hub or Huggingface
  - try finetuning GPT-3
